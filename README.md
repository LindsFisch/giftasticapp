### Overview

Used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of TV shows. The app calls the GIPHY API and uses JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.  When gif displays, it will be a static image until user clicks on it to 'play' the gif.  When you clicks on it again, it will put it back to a static image.   User can also add new gifs to the page by inputing data in the text field.
